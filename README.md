## What problem Pix Collab solves?

Are you tired of splitting the bill at restaurants, cafes, and other places with your friends? Do you struggle to keep track of who owes what and end up with awkward conversations about money? If so, you're not alone.

Pix is a fast, secure, and convenient payment method in Brazil, but it's not always easy to use, especially when you want to split a charge among multiple people. With Pix Collab, you can easily split the bill with your friends and pay using Pix. Our app generates multiple Pix charges for a single bill, each with the exact amount that each person owes, making it easier for everyone to pay their share.
